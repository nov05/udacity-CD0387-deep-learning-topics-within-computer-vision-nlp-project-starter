# **Image Classification using AWS SageMaker**

Use AWS Sagemaker to train a pretrained model that can perform image classification by using the Sagemaker profiling, debugger, hyperparameter tuning and other good ML engineering practices. This can be done on either [the provided dog breed classication data set](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) or one of your choice.

## Project Set Up and Installation
Enter AWS through the gateway in the course and open SageMaker Studio. 
Download the starter files.
Download/Make the dataset available. 

## üëâ Dataset
The provided dataset is [the dogbreed classification dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) which can be found in the classroom.
The project is designed to be dataset independent so if there is a dataset that is more interesting or relevant to your work, you are welcome to use it to complete the project.

* Simple data exploration ([notebook](https://github.com/nov05/udacity-CD0387-deep-learning-topics-within-computer-vision-nlp-project-starter/blob/main/00.EDA.ipynb))  
  * Download two pictures to local and display them  
  * There are **133 classes** (133 dog breeds) and there is data imbalance. In the [`scripts/train.py`](https://github.com/nov05/udacity-CD0387-deep-learning-topics-within-computer-vision-nlp-project-starter/blob/main/scripts/train.py) file, `class weights` are added to the loss function. And two test run show that it improves the accuracy from 74% to 79% for `ResNet50`.  
    ```python
    class_weights = compute_class_weight(
        class_weight='balanced', 
        classes=np.unique(train_dataset.targets), 
        y=train_dataset.targets)
    class_weights = torch.tensor(class_weights, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)  
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)  
    ```

### üè∑Ô∏è Access
Upload the data to an S3 bucket through the AWS Gateway so that SageMaker has access to the data. 
* Added `AmazonS3FullAccess` permission to the SageMaker execution role.

* A bucket `p3-dog-breed-classification` is created to store the project data.  
    * Folder `dogImages/` stores all the dog pictures
    * Folder `jobs/` stores all the job outputs

## üëâ Hyperparameter Tuning
What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search

Remember that your README should:
- Include a screenshot of completed training jobs
- Logs metrics during the training process
- Tune at least two hyperparameters
- Retrieve the best hyperparameters from all your training jobs

## üëâ Debugging and Profiling
**TODO**: Give an overview of how you performed model debugging and profiling in Sagemaker

### üè∑Ô∏è Results
**TODO**: What are the results/insights did you get by profiling/debugging your model?

**TODO** Remember to provide the profiler html/pdf file in your submission.


## üëâ Model Deployment
**TODO**: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

**TODO** Remember to provide a screenshot of the deployed active endpoint in Sagemaker.

## Standout Suggestions
**TODO (Optional):** This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
